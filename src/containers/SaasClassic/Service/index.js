          <p>
            The Coin Rivet Invitational powered by Triton Poker, at the Luxon
            Pay Mediterranean Poker Party is a special new event at Merit Royal
            Diamond, North Cyprus. The event is a $200,000 NLH single re-entry
            tournament. Taking inspiration from the unique format of the record
            breaking Triton Million that took place in London in 2019 the event
            sees the pairing of professional players with wealthy recreational
            players. On day one the professional players and recreational
            players are separated before the fields are merged on day two.
            Players are encouraged to find themselves a pairing just like they
            did at the historic Triton event in London.
